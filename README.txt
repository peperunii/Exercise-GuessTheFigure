This is a small console Exercise "Guess the figure" written on C.
Compiled succesfully using Windows 7 / Visual Studio 2013

About this Exercise:
- I did this exercise on two interviews.
-The problem is defined as:
 Given a number of points and their coordinates (X,Y) find if there are at least 3 point lying on a straight line and if there isn't any, find if there is a figure formed from the points
  - Square
  - Parallelogram 
  - Rectangle
  - Trapezoid
  
I've added a small function so that the result can be visualized.
